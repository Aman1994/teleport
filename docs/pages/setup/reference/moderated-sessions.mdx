# Moderated Sessions

Moderated Sessions makes use of RBAC to control access to and within sessions.
Here is a collection of details on configuring Moderated Sessions.

## RBAC

Moderated Sessions makes use of RBAC policies to allow for fine grained control over
who can join a session and who are required to be present to start one.

The system is based around **require policies** and allow policies. Require policies define a set of conditions
that must be a met for a session to start/run.

**Allow policies** are used to define what sessions a user can join
and under what conditions they may join a session.

### Session kinds

Require and allow policies have to specify which sessions they apply to. Valid options are `ssh` and `k8s`.

### Filters

A filter expression or predicate is a string statement used to define logic based on a set of input variables.
These follow common programming language syntax and allow for more detailed control.
`user.name == "adam" || contains(user.traits, "view")` is a simple example of a filter expression
that evaluates to true if the user is Adam or if the user has the trait `view`.

Require policies can specify which users they consider as valid with a filter expression. They work like
other filters used within Teleport such with access requests. The filter context has a `user` object defined
which the set fields `roles`, `traits` and `name`.

### Backwards compatibility with Server Access

Previously, Server Access did not include controls over which users can join a session.
To work around this, RBAC rules are ignored for users that only have V4 roles (`version: v4` in the role specification).
New roles are created as V5. V4 roles are upgraded when they are modified in the UI.
If a user has any attached V5 roles, the new RBAC access checks will be enforced.

### Example require policy

The policy below specifies that a given role
must have a minimum of two users with the role `auditor` and the mode `moderator` present in the session
to start it. The policy applies to SSH and Kubernetes sessions only.

When a user with this require policy starts a session, it will be pending
until the policy is fulfilled.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: prod-access
spec:
  allow:
    require_session_join:
      - name: Auditor oversight
        filter: 'contains(user.roles, "auditor")'
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator']
```

### Example allow policy

The following allow policy attaches to the role `auditor` and allows one to join
SSH and Kubernetes sessions started by a user with the role `prod_access` as a moderator or observer.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: auditor
spec:
  allow:
    join_sessions:
      - name: Auditor oversight
        roles : ['prod-access']
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator', 'observer']
```

## MFA-based presence

When `mfa_required` is set to `true` via role or cluster settings, Teleport enforces
MFA-based presence checks for moderators.
This requires that all moderators wishing to join have a configured U2F or WebAuthn MFA token.

Every 30 seconds, Teleport will issue a prompt to the user in the terminal, asking them
to press their MFA token in the next 15 seconds. This will happen continously during the session
and exists so that moderators are always present and watching a given session.

If no MFA input is received within 60 seconds, the user is kicked
from the session which may pause it, if RBAC policies are no longer met.

### Participant Modes

A participant joining a session will always have one of three modes:
- Peers can join and collaborate in a session. They can view output and send input.
- Moderators can join and watch a session. They can view output and forcefully terminate the session at will.
- Observers can join and watch a session. They cannot control the session in any way.

When joining a session with `tsh join` or `tsh kube join`, a mode can be specified with `--mode <mode>`
where mode is one of `peer`, `moderator` or `observer`. By default, the mode is `peer` for SSH and
`moderator` for Kubernetes sessions.

A participant may leave a session with the shortcut `c` while in observer or moderator mode.
When in moderator mode, a participant may also forcefully terminate the session at any point in time
with the shortcut `t`.
